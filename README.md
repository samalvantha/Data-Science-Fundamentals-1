# US Medical Insurance Data Analysis

The sample data for this project includes US medical patients and their stats that decide their insurance cost. In this project, each field is stored into separate variables and is used to answer our questions about the demographics of our dataset and how important those are to their insurance cost. This project and sample data was provided from Codecademy and the Data Science: Machine Specialist Career Path course.
